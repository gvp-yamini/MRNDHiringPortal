          <p>Before entering MRND, I never knew the importance of code quality, the frequently evolving technologies and the competition levels of coders in my age. I expected that MRND would give me a platform where I can hone and showcase my skills. The monthly classes helped to keep up my focus consistently. Peri sir’s lectures constantly motivated me to push myself till I achieved my goals. During the summer course, the most important thing that I learnt is teamwork, to stay focused and code till the project/tasks given to us were completed, new proramming languages that simplify coding effort. The course seemed tough initially, but that is what is required to drive yourself. At the end of the day, MRND is a great platform for budding programmers to prove themselves to the world. MRND not only helps you to develop your skill set, but also helps in your overall development. MRND is a definite course for students who want to learn constantly. I feel students who have gone through all the screenings and courses without dropping out are most probably going to be a great product developers.</p>

          <p>Personally, I had little to no clue as to how the corporate world functioned or what they expected out of a fresher in terms of behavioural or technical aspect. Perseverance is one of the many traits that I acquired in during the pre-summer classes. The exercises and assignments given didn’t only improve me on a technical front but also gave me an opportunity to learn things on my own unlike the other institutions where I previously studied in. I expected a steep learning curve technically. During the summer course I experienced a colossal growth, both technically and personally. I was given an opportunity to connect with like minded people who hail from various parts of the state, all having a common and intense objective to acquire a strong hold on the subject they love. The experience helped me in becoming nimble on the technical side, thus enabling me to learn new technologies with ease. The projects given were challenging, fun, educative all at the same time. Working in teams to complete them added to our professionalism by mocking the environment we would face in the corporate world.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>The course also encouraged me in building my orative skills in an articulate manner by allowing me to put forth my ideas during the soft skills exercises. It was definitely one of the best things that happened to me, it facilitated an overall development in my professional and personal life as well.</p>

          <p>Before entering MRND, I didn’t know how to think for the solution for a problem and what are scenarios the code might fail. During the pre-summer classes, I learnt to organise the code, to think for better solutions always and to test the code. Honestly I was expecting nothing more than coding from the course but the summer classes taught me how industry professionals think and work, and that just writing code isn’t enough.
MRND is the place where I learnt not only how to code but also how to learn from others and help others. It was all about learning everything the right way.</p>

          <p>Through MRND, I learnt the different ways in which a problem can be perceived and solved. Before joining MRND, my expectations from the course were to strengthen my programming skills and master data structures. I hoped this programme would expose me to real-world programming as done in leading product companies. Thus, bridging the gap between academics and the industry, and enabling me to become a competent software developer. During summer classes, we were given a challenging set of questions each day to solve, as in a Hackathon, which engulfed us completely, and are fairly complex. We enjoyed solving these programs and learning different aspects of product development every day. MRND was a golden opportunity that came my way and laid the foundation of my learning. The enormous amount of time and effort that the faculty and the mentors spend in designing the course inspires students to learn more, each day. It enables one to understand real-world programming practices better, and bridges the gap between academics and the industry. Apart from this, it teaches one how to endure stressful situations confidently and stresses on the importance of time management. On the whole, it was an amazing and edifying experience!</p>

          <p>I knew nothing about how software industry works. I didn’t know what I needed to achieve to fit into this industry. All I thought that knowing C and JAVA was enough for a software professional. During the pre-summer classes, I learnt that hard work is the most important thing. I used to work a bit more than what I used work usually, which slowly increased my stability levels. I also felt the joy in learning new things. It always provided me with positivity, especially during the python course. It was refreshing to meet new people in a new place during the summer course. I have learnt many new technologies like Node.JS, Facebook Graph API’s, many core concepts like Compiler Design, Distributed Data Bases, B+ trees, Client Server Communication and problem solving. During the course we worked in teams which was a different thing that I have never experienced before. This taught me to share and learn from my peers. From MRND course, professionally, I learnt how to learn which is a basic skill that is needed to run along in the software industry. Personally, my perspective on treating people changed a lot in this course. I gained a lot of positive energy form this course. I achieved “emotional equilibrium” and learned how to manage my professional and personal tasks simultaneously.</p>

          <p>As a student I had no exposure towards how things in Industry are built and done. I was in an assumption of learning a programming language would suffice. From the pre-summer classes instead of just straight away coding a problem, I have learnt how to analyse a problem and solve it in “N” possible ways. I expected to gain skill in coding, problem solving and complexity analysis. Since the faulty who taught were from a strong technical role in large MNCs, I could gain knowledge on what the industry expects and what must be delivered to cater their need. I have learnt how to build end-to-end apps using libraries. The very same apps I have learnt on how to build from systems level. Building systems apps was a plunge into ocean of computer science. I could learn how to handle real time scenarios of a software which is in production.Overall, there is a sharp learning curve. Throughout the course every single problem I was given made me to learn how to think in a different way rather than approaching a general approach. I have learnt that there is a wide spectrum of problems which can be solved by computer science.</p>

          <p>Before joining MRND, I didn’t know how to build real-time software and use the resources available on the web to learn, how to build things. I expected the course to teach me how to build an application from one end to another. I learnt to push myself harder to make submissions on time and also not to give up on things and not to make excuse for doing so. I learnt to use my time more efficiently handling my college work and MRND work simultaneously. There are 4 things that I have learnt from the summer course. They are making use of the web to learn to build applications, professional skills to plan my career, soft skills and confidence to speak out what I wanted to convey to people. Mission R&D is not only about teaching computer science.</p> 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It is about making more rounded individuals and professionals. Things like these cannot be learnt from anywhere else. If I had to tell one thing that changed the way I see myself and life it is Mission R&D.</p>

          <p>It helped me a lot in changing my thought process and it helped me to explore and work with new technologies like Cloud Computing especially made me aware of how to work with Windows Azure and Amazon Cloud service providers. Generally, in regular college classes, we will learn the steps of how to build products theoretically but the faculty at Mission R & D made us follow those steps and made us capable of building products like Document Repository. Faculty at Mission R & D made us learn “how to learn”. They made us know how the building of a product happens in the software industries and made us follow that process. They made us work as a team which is essential quality a software professional should possess. The goals of Mission R & D are very clear that they want to transfer the knowledge from a generation of highly qualified R & D professionals to the future generation of software professionals. It made me capable of writing productive and efficient code and gave me confidence that I can build a product of my own. Without enrolling to Mission R & D I may lose a great opportunity to meet such a well qualified professionals and their teaching.</p>

          <p>Before getting into MRND course, I had no clue about many concepts like time and space complexities, memory management, latest technologies like nodeJS, Python. With the help of Pre-Summer classes, I have learnt to use different data structures and problem solving algorithms which helped me solve good real time problems like maze. This course helped me in learning the core concepts of computer science.During Summer course we developed an end-to-end project which includes website development, server and database management using latest cutting edge technologies,building forums etc. Got a very good hands-on experience on concepts like threading,file management,writing API’s etc. Overall I had a very good learning experience in this course. It has made everyone realize their potential to the fullest and has laid a platform to all the students where they can continue to improve their skills. There is no spoon feeding here. This is a self-learning platform.</p>

          <p>I had very less knowledge on data structures and problem solving techniques before getting into MRND course. In Pre-Summer classes, I got a chance to solve a lot of problems which in turn helped improve my problem solving abilities. It helped me gain practical knowledge regarding many things like time and space complexities. Summer classes had a very good environment where everyone is passionate about learning.We got guidance from the top software professionals in industry. I have learnt many things like effective usage of data structures, how core concepts of computer science are built, working in teams,interacting with people etc. I came to know the real importance of discussions with mentors.I could also pull up my confidence levels to a great extent. With the best software professionals in the industry guiding you at every step, and the best environment where everyone is as smart as you are, I have learnt the beauty of computer science by designing the core concepts like networking, file-systems, etc. using concepts of data structures and problem solving algorithms.</p> 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Apart from the technical stuff, this course helped me in understanding the other dimension of life in terms of personal development, how to interact with people and work together. During this course I have gained tremendous amount of confidence which is helping me progress in my career. With a strong motive of “learn how to learn”, this course is a 360 degree view of what happens in a product company.</p>

          <p>Prior to MRND course, I was weak in coding skills and computer science fundamentals. Problem solving was also an issue. Pre-Summer classes helped me improve my coding skills.It also helped me in getting well-versed with computer science fundamentals and problem solving techniques. During Summer course, I have truly learnt how to learn and how to thrive under pressure. It has greatly improved my problem solving abilities. It was actually a reality check. I came out of the course realising that I need to work much harder. Got all that I have expected out of the course and more! This is a great course to learn computer science.</p>

          <p>I was living in a nut shell prior to MRND. Pre-Summer classes taught me how to write good, crisp code and opened up a new perspective as in how to look at a given problem, and other internals of things, be it a standard library function or a data structure or any other topic. Summer course taught me how to look at things in differnt ways, how to convert an idea to code, how to pick up something and get hands on, to be precise the summer course taught me how to learn things, how to apply what you’ve learned to tackle a problem. Apart from these, it taught me to work with the strengths and weaknesses of a team, how to articulate things and many more.
MRND is one of the best thing that can happen to an individual in terms of expanding the spectrum of your perspective as in the way you look at things, they way you understand things and implement them. Apart from the technical aspects, MRND helped shape my persona to what I am today.</p>
